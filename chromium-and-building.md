## Building

This material was formerly hosted at https://gist.github.com/domfarolino/359a01b65241cbebf1224b666c9d89fd.

#### GN Args / Build Configuration

 - [Linux Build Instructions](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/linux/build_instructions.md)
 - [macOS Build Instructions](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/mac_build_instructions.md)
 - [GN build configuration docs](https://www.chromium.org/developers/gn-build-configuration)

My GN args:

```
# Set build arguments here. See `gn help buildargs`.
use_goma = true
is_debug = true
symbol_level = 2
blink_symbol_level = 2
dcheck_always_on = true
enable_nacl = false
```

#### Common commands and targets
```
$ git rebase-update && gclient sync
$ autoninja -C out/Default chrome blink_tests browser_tests content_browsertests net_unittests
```

When using Goma, it can be convenient to still be able to perform incremental builds
without internet access. To avoid having to switch the GN arg `use_goma = false` and
recompiling entirely, you can just use the following in the terminal:

```
export GOMA_DISABLED=true
```

## Debugging

The LLDB debugger for macOS is what I primarily use. Historically just invoking
`lldb ./out/Debug/binary_here` was enough to debug Chromium, however now we must
also follow the [lldbinit docs](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/lldbinit.md).

Also, for some reason to attach `lldb` to the Network Service process you must
[run `lldb` as root](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/network-service-dev/QzPyRlxm_1A).
This means your lldb will be consulting the root user's `~/.lldbinit` file, so
you might also need to follow the above lldbinit instructions for the root user's
`~/.lldbinit` too.

### Debugging a renderer process

If you want to debug a renderer process, you have two choices:

 - Run Chrome as usual, then go to HamburgerMenu > More Tools > Task Manager,
   use the pid of the renderer process of interest for LLDB
 - If you need to debug something in a renderer's initialization code that you
   can't attach a breakpoint to quick enough, launch Chrome with the
   `--renderer-startup-dialog` flag. This will spit out a pid in the terminal
   for the renderer that was created, that you can use as the pid for LLDB.
   Alternatively, you can add `sleep(20)` or so in `//content/renderer/renderer_main.cc`
   => `RendererMain()`

### Debugging the browser process

Like before, you have a few choices:

 - Run Chrome as usual, then go to HamburgerMenu > More Tools > Task Manager,
   use the pid of the browser process for LLDB.
 - If you need to debug something early in the browser process's initialization
   code that you can't attach a breakpoint to quick enough, you have two options:
    - Add `sleep(20);` in `//content/app/content_main_runner_impl.cc` =>
      `ContentMainRunnerImpl::RunServiceManager()`
    - jbroman@ says that you can also launch Chrome with the `--wait-for-debugger`
      command line flag, which sounds similar to the `--renderer-startup-dialog` flag


## Testing

#### Google Tests

Example: the `blink_platform_unittests` and `blink_unittests` (previously `webkit_unit_tests`) targets:

```
./out/Debug/blink_unittests --gtest_filter="HTMLPreloadScannerDocumentTest.XHRResponseDocument"
./out/Debug/blink_platform_unittests --gtest_filter="ResourceFetcherTest.UseExistingResource"
./out/Debug/blink_platform_unittests --gtest_filter="ResourceFetcherTest.*"
```

Useful Google Test Flags:

```
--test-launcher-retry-limit=0
```

Multiple [inclusions/exclusions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14018434):

```
--gtest_filter="POSITIVE_PATTERNS:AND_MORE[-NEGATIVE_PATTERNS:AND_MORE]"
```

Example:

```
--gtest_filter="ResourceFetcherTest.*-ResourceFetcherTest.StartLoadAfterFrameDetach:ResourceFetcherTest.Vary"
```

#### WPTs & Layout Tests:

 - [WPT](http://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt) docs
 - [Chromium "web tests"](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/testing/web_tests.md#Running-Web-Tests) docs
 - [WPT local setup](https://web-platform-tests.org/running-tests/from-local-system.html#system-setup)
 - [Trusting root CA](https://web-platform-tests.org/tools/certs/README.html)
   - To easily get `https` tests working locally
 - [testharness.js API](https://web-platform-tests.org/writing-tests/testharness-api.html)
   - Super useful to learn testharness APIs i.e., that `promise_test`s run sequentially,
     how to use `t.step_func()`, or the difference between `add_result_callback()` and
     `add_completion_callback()`. Also it is not super easy to find for some reason I think

Running layout tests:
```
python third_party/blink/tools/run_web_tests.py -t Debug http/tests/security/referrer-policy-conflicting-policies.html external/wpt/workers
```

Useful flags:
 - `--no-retry-failures`
 - `--fully-parallel`
   - When running WPTs, your machine spins up an "appropriate" number of content shells
     for parallelization. As the number of remaining WPTs decrease, your machine decreases
     the number of content shells running in parallel. Even when running up to ~80 tests,
     your machine mayÂ start many content shells and _quickly_ reduce the number, slowing down
     the run. This flag forces the machine to use as many content shells as it would for an
     enormous number of tests, all the way through the end.

The last set of test results are always available at:

```

```

##### Testharness notes / useful things:

If you want to use a cross-origin in a test, you have two options:

1. Sub test
   - Make the test name of the format `test-name.sub.html` or `test-name.sub.https.html`
   - This makes the test run through the server-side substitutor(?) before it is served
   - Therefore you can use things like the following to create origins:
     - `http://{{domains[www1]}}:{{ports[http][0]}}/html/`
     - `http://{{domains[wwww]}}:{{ports[https][0]}}/html/`
1. Import the `get-host-info` helper
   - `<script src="/common/get-host-info.sub.js"></script>`
   - `URL(get_host_info().HTTPS_REMOTE_ORIGIN + '/worklets/resources/referrer-checker.py');`

Image progressive rendering. There exists a python resource that responds with a
progressively-rendered image, at `/element-timing/resources/progressive-image.py`. You can
see it being used in the following CL:
`https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/2138994/3/third_party/blink/web_tests/external/wpt/preload/subresource-integrity-partial-image.html#25`.
